---------- PAGE TWO ----------

What makes the study of human geography unique? (3 main points to understand)

- relationship between humans and their enviorment
- geographic scales
- proccesses based on location

Explain the two key perspectives used by geographers to understand geographic patterns and processes.

Spacial Perspective:
- where something occurs
Ecological Perspective:
- relationships between living things and their enviorments

---------- PAGE THREE ----------

Explain the difference between absolute and relative location.

Absolute Location:
- exact location (absolute)
Relative Location:
- relative to other locations nearby

What is a mental map? What affect idividuals' mental maps?
- Internalized portions and points of interest

How do site and situation factor into the way geographers analyze place?
- site: natural features and pysical characteristics of the land
- situation: relation to resources and points of interest
- Influences the usage of the land

Which concepts do geographers use to understand distribution? How are these two concepts defined?
- density and pattern
- density: number of things
- pattern: how things are arranged

---------- PAGE FOUR ----------

Explain the two major theories of human-environment interaction.
Environmental Determinism:
- human behavior is based on environmental factors
Possibilism:
- individuals have influence on their actions and not only because of the enviorment

Use the inset on page 10. Compare the two models geographers use to analyze spatial features, processes, and relationships.
Distance decay:
- Information decays overtime and it takes time to travel over distances
Time-Space Compression:
- Information travels significantly faster due to the internet and modern day transportation

---------- PAGE FIVE ----------

Explain why New Orleans founders decided that the advantage of the location's situation outweighed the disadvantages of its site.
- Located on the southern end of the missisippi, meaning that it was a natural trade hub, as well as having land to expand onto.

What is sustainability? Explain how natural resources play a role with sustainability.
- Concervation of non-renewables and producing more renewable resources than you consume

Explain how using different scales of analysis helps geographers understand the ways climate change is affesting the planet.
- A problem may only be clear how to solve once zooming in (macro vs micro)

---------- PAGE SIX ----------

Why are regions a useful tool for geographers?
- to define areas based on culture, economical, traditional, and physical features

Explain the purposes and uses for the three different types of regions.
Formal Region:
One or more shared traits, "Uniform Regions"
Functional Region:
- organized by function, around a central point or "node". Mainly focused on interests or activities.
Perceptual Region (Vernacular):
- attitudes and perceptions of a place

Explain why geographers might have concerns about growing inequality in India.
- some parts are very rich and some are very poor, in a polarizing manner.

---------- PAGE SEVEN ----------

What are some of the key causes and effects of globalization?
Causes:
- lower production costs and high-speed communication
Effects:
- information and culture spread at an increased rate

Explain Wallerstein's World System Theory (reference the graphic on pp. 22)
- Core countries rely on periphery countries for cheap labor and natural resources, periphery countries rely on core countries for consumer goods and money. Semi-periphery is a mix between the two.

Explain why sustainability is an important theme in the study of human geography.
- So the world doesn't result in the collapse of countires and the economic scene
